# OOP-Data-Cleaning-Pipeline-Manager-Salary-Survey

### 📚 University Project – Object-Oriented Programming CA

This project was completed during my **second year** of the **BSc in Mathematics and Data Science** at **Dundalk Institute of Technology**, as part of the continuous assessment for the **Object-Oriented Programming** module. The objective was to build a reusable, modular data cleaning pipeline using the **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern in Python.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to clean and prepare a messy dataset (`manager_salary_survey.csv`) for numerical analysis. The process involved:
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identifying missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers
- Designing a chain of data cleaning tasks using object-oriented principles
- Saving the cleaned dataset for further analysis

The cleaning tasks were structured into an automated pipeline using **OOP best practices**, ensuring each step could be reused or extended with minimal changes to the codebase.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Download the Project Files**
   - Click the green **"Code"** button at the top of the repository.
   - Select **"Download ZIP"** and extract the folder on your computer.

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**
   - Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
   - Open the `DataCleaningManagerSalarySurvey.ipynb` file using Jupyter.
   - Run each cell in order to explore the data and follow the full cleaning pipeline.

> 📁 Make sure the dataset file `manager_salary_survey.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook. If it's missing, the code will not work correctly.
