# OOP-Data-Cleaning-Pipeline-Manager-Salary-Survey

### ðŸ“š University Project â€“ Object-Oriented Programming CA

This project was completed during my **second year** of the **BSc in Mathematics and Data Science** at **Dundalk Institute of Technology**, as part of the continuous assessment for the **Object-Oriented Programming** module. The objective was to build a reusable, modular data cleaning pipeline using the **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern in Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to clean and prepare a messy dataset (`manager_salary_survey.csv`) for numerical analysis. The process involved:
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identifying missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers
- Designing a chain of data cleaning tasks using object-oriented principles
- Saving the cleaned dataset for further analysis

The cleaning tasks were structured into an automated pipeline using **OOP best practices**, ensuring each step could be reused or extended with minimal changes to the codebase.
